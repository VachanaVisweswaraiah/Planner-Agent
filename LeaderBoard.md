# Calendar Scheduling Leaderboard

This project evaluates and compares multiple Small Language Models (SLMs) on a **calendar scheduling task** using a professor-provided evaluation script.  
The goal is to **identify which SLM performs best** and clearly justify the choice using a ranked leaderboard.

---

## 📌 What This Does

1. **Takes model output files**  
   Each JSON file contains predictions generated by one SLM for the calendar scheduling dataset.

2. **Uses the official evaluation script (unchanged)**  
   The script `evaluate_calendar_scheduling.py` (provided by the professor) is treated as a **black box** and is run on each output file to obtain the **real solve rate**.

3. **Ranks models by real performance**  
   - No normalization
   - No rescaling
   - The solve rate is used exactly as reported by the evaluator (e.g. `0.2290`)

4. **Generates an interpretable leaderboard**  
   The leaderboard includes:
   - Rank
   - Model name
   - Parameter size
   - Solve rate
   - Verdict (Best overall / Strong alternative / Acceptable / Not recommended)

5. **Explains *why* a model is better**  
   Strengths and limitations are assigned **based on rank**, not generic text.  
   This provides a clear justification for selecting the top models.

6. **Automatically exports a PDF**  
   A publication-ready file `leaderboard.pdf` is generated using ReportLab.

## 📊 Output

### 1. Leaderboard Table
Ranks all evaluated models by **real solve rate**.

### 2. Strengths & Limitations Table
Provides **rank-aware qualitative explanations** answering:
> *Why should we choose the top models over the others?*

### 3. PDF Export
The final result is saved as:


## ▶️ How to Run

Run the leaderboard script with the model output files:

```bash
python3 create_leaderboard_v2.py \
  data/output_gemma_e2b_calender.json \
  data/output_gemma_2_9b_it_calender.json \
  data/output_mistral_7b_ollama.json \
  data/output_qwen2.5_7b_ollama.json \
  data/output_llama3_8b_ollama.json
